  <strong>Conclusion:</stron>
  <p>The highest drug overdose deaths and crimes committed per state occur in California. This fact stayed consistent through the years we monitored with the other states staying relatively consistent as well. This shows that there were no considerable spikes throughout the years observed in any one place in the US. We can see that states with a high rate of crime statistically have a high amount of drug overdose deaths. However, we can also infer that the population of the states themselves influenced this data just from the sheer volume of individuals that apply to these statics.</p>
