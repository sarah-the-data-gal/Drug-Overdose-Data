# Overdose-Metrics-Analysis
# Project Overview and Purpose:
  For this project, our group was tasked with creating a story using data visualizations. The purpose was to test and apply the lessons we have learned in this bootcamp so far. Our group chose the data visualization track, in which we utilized Python, JavaScript, HTML, as well as PgAdmin. The visualizations that were created are meant to demonstrate that we have the capabilities to create materials that have interactive elements to it. Interactive visualizations are important because they can help people understand the data more effectively and persuasively. Being able to create interactive visualizations demonstrates that our group will be able to better engage our audience and make the data more memorable. 
# Ethical Considerations
  In our project on drug overdose deaths, we have rigorously adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the Belmont Report: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. We ensure respect for persons by obtaining data that maintains anonymity of all participants. To do good and avoid harm, we carefully reviewed our methods. We aimed to be fair by making sure our research benefits everyone affected without any bias. Additionally, we sourced our data from reliable government sources, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our findings. Government agencies are bound by stringent regulations and laws, such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the United States, which mandate strict privacy and security standards for handling personal health information. These agencies invest heavily in advanced security infrastructure and protocols to protect data from breaches and unauthorized access. 

# Navigating the Project Repo
  Our group created three visualizations—a line graph, a bar graph, and a pie chart—to analyze drug overdose deaths. The line graph showed a rapid increase in drug-related deaths until 2017, after which the trend steadied before the pandemic. The data, sourced from 2019, revealed that California had the highest number of overdose deaths, likely due to its large population, as the data was not adjusted on a per-capita basis. This trend was consistent over the years, indicating no significant spikes or outliers across the United States. Monthly data from 2015 to 2019 indicated no significant changes, with the highest number of deaths occurring between November and February, peaking in December. This pattern suggests a correlation between being indoors during winter and increased rates of drug consumption, highlighting the seasonal influence on overdose deaths.
